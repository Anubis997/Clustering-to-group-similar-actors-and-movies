# Clustering-to-group-similar-actors-and-movies
Vectorised all the nodes in a bipartite graph using Word2vec after initialising a randomwalk by defining metapaths using StellarGraph. Actors and movies have been succesfully segregated
into 200 and 400 clusters respectively using Kmeans, hyperparemeter optimisation with customised cost functions and results were extrapolated using T-SNE as T-SNE is better at non linear dimensionality reduction.
