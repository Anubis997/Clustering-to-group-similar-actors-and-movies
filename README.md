# Clustering-to-group-similar-actors-and-movies
Vectorised all the nodes in a bipartite graph using Word2vec after initialising a randomwalk by defining metapaths. Actors and movies have been succesfully segregated
into 200 and 400 clusters respectively and results were extrapolated using T-SNE as T-SNE is better at non linear dimensionality reduction.
